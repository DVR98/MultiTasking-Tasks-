# MultiTasking(Tasks)
When the App is launched, it will ask you to choose between 6 options to show different ways you could achieve an end result by using tasks. You must enter a number between 1 and 6. Do not wory if you entered a number larger or smaller than the provided range, I ALWAYS implement validation and exception handling ;)

### Options:
1) Basic Task: Writes 1 to 100 by running a task.
2) ReturnValue Task: Returns a value that was calculated through a Task.
3) CancelFaultComplete Task: Shows how to you could Cancel, Fault or Complete a Task.
4) Parent Children Task: Shows how to manage parent- and children Tasks.
5) TaskFactory Task: Shows how you can use the TaskFactory class to manage and configure the Task's functionality(Async, Sync, etc.).
6) KeepTrack Task: Shows how you can keep track of various tasks that run asynchronously.
